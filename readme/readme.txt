# pacman

Hello. this is my own pacman clone written in Java.
It took me much to long to finally finish a full enjoyable version of it.
But in the end it now features a leveleditor, custom level, a few start level and a highscore list.

Im not that proud of the the AI of the ghosts, but since it's my first attempt I think its still playable.

Control:
W, A, S, D = control pacman
UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT keys = control pacman

P = pause
ESC = leave game to menu, score will be lost
(in gameover animation you can press esc to skip animation WITHOUT loosing the score)

Cheats
+ = increase tickspeed
- = reduce tickspeed
x = show target fields of ghosts




Editor:
You can only play your own created level if it is valid.
That means your level need to:
- have all spawns set
- have no white tiles left
- have no eatables surrounded by walls 

You cannot chose a name for your level that is already taken.
Level you don't like anymore can be deleted in the level folder.
You dont have to set every tile by a click, you can just hold down your left mouse button and drag it
over your level
