# pacman

Hello. this is my own pacman clone written in Java.<br>
It took me much to long to finally finish a full enjoyable version of it.<br>
But in the end it now features a leveleditor, custom level, a few start level and a <br>highscore list.<br>
<br>
Im not that proud of the the AI of the ghosts, but since it's my first attempt I <br>think<br> its still playable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Control:<br>
W, A, S, D = control pacman<br>
UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT keys = control pacman<br>
<br>
P = pause<br>
ESC = leave game to menu, score will be lost<br>
(in gameover animation you can press esc to skip animation WITHOUT loosing the score)<br>
<br>
Cheats<br>
plus = increase tickspeed<br>
minus = reduce tickspeed<br>
x = show target fields of ghosts<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Editor:<br>
You can only play your own created level if it is valid.<br>
That means your level need to:<br>
* have all spawns set<br>
* have no white tiles left<br>
* have no eatables surrounded by walls<br>
<br>
<br>
You cannot chose a name for your level that is already taken.<br>
Level you don't like anymore can be deleted in the level folder.<br>
You dont have to set every tile by a click, you can just hold down your left mouse button and drag it over your level
